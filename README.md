#The code within this repository consist of scripts that I have written or coauthored towards the completion of my PhD thesis at the University of Arizona
#Each script is annotated to a varying degree, but will be fully annotated and published alongside peer-reviewed publications resulting from my thesis. 

#I will update these scripts periodically: Up to date as of 3-Nov-2021
